## ✅ How to Fix

### **Step 1: Enable the API**

Click this link (or copy-paste into browser):

https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/texttospeech.googleapis.com/overview?project=179100345619
```

### **Step 2: Click "ENABLE"**

## 🎯 What This Fixes

Once enabled, the TTS (text-to-speech) will work and:
- Generate actual pronunciation audio
- Students can tap words and HEAR how to say them
- Instead of just seeing text feedback, they'll hear the correct pronunciation

---

## 🔍 Current Workaround

While TTS is not working, I've improved the feedback text to be super helpful:

### **Before:**
```
"Try the 'i' sound like 'ih'"
```

### **After (NEW):**
```
"🎯 You should say 'sits' (you said 'sat'). 
You got the beginning 's' sound and the 't' sound, 
but let's practice the 'i' sound in the middle 
and remember the 's' at the very end to make 'sits'."
```

Now when students tap on words, they'll see:
- ✅ What they SHOULD have said
- ❌ What they ACTUALLY said  
- 🎓 Specific tips on how to fix it

## 📋 Summary

**Do this NOW:**
1. Click the link above
2. Click "ENABLE" button
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Test again

**Already working:**
- ✅ Improved AI pronunciation analysis (stricter, more accurate)
- ✅ Better text feedback (shows what to say + how to fix it)
- ⏳ Audio pronunciation (will work once API is enabled)

After enabling the API, students will get BOTH:
- 📝 Detailed text feedback
- 🔊 Audio pronunciation to hear the correct sound
