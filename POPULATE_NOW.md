## ðŸ“š How to Add 40+ Reading Passages

### **Step 1: Wait for Deployment**

Render is deploying now. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete.

Check status at: https://dashboard.render.com/

### **Step 2: Call the Populate Endpoint**

**Method 1: Using Browser**

Open this URL in your browser:
```
https://brainink-backend.onrender.com/after-school/reading-assistant/admin/populate-reading-content?clear_existing=false
```

**Method 2: Using PowerShell**

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://brainink-backend.onrender.com/after-school/reading-assistant/admin/populate-reading-content" -Method POST
```

**Method 3: Using curl (if available)**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://brainink-backend.onrender.com/after-school/reading-assistant/admin/populate-reading-content"
```

### **Step 3: Check the Results**

The endpoint will return JSON like:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully added 28 new reading passages",
  "added_count": 28,
  "skipped_count": 0,
  "total_in_database": 28,
  "summary_by_level": {
    "KINDERGARTEN": 10,
    "GRADE_1": 12,
    "GRADE_2": 4,
    "GRADE_3": 2
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Verify Content Was Added**

Check stats at:
```
https://brainink-backend.onrender.com/after-school/reading-assistant/admin/reading-content-stats
```

You should see:
```json

## ðŸ§ª Test the Improved AI

The AI is already improved and working! Test it now:

1. Open mobile app
2. Go to Reading Assistant
3. Choose any reading passage
4. Record yourself reading
5. **Intentionally mispronounce a word** (e.g., say "sat" instead of "sits")
6. Check the feedback

**Expected Result:**
- Old AI: "Great job!" (overly encouraging)
- **New AI:** "You said 'sat' but the word is 'sits'. Practice the 'i' sound and remember the 's' at the end!" (accurate and educational)
