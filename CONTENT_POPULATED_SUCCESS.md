## 🔊 Next: Enable TTS Audio

The only thing left is to enable the Text-to-Speech API so students can HEAR pronunciations.

**Do this:**
1. Go to: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/texttospeech.googleapis.com/overview?project=179100345619
2. Click "ENABLE"
3. Wait 5 minutes

Until then, students see helpful text feedback like:
> "🎯 You should say 'sits' (you said 'sat'). You got the beginning 's' sound and the 't' sound, but let's practice the 'i' sound in the middle and remember the 's' at the very end to make 'sits'."
