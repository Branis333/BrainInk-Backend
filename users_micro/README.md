# BrainInk Backend - User Microservice

This microservice handles user management, authentication, school management, academic management, and grade management for the BrainInk application.

## Project Structure

The project has been refactored to have a cleaner, more maintainable structure:

### Endpoints

The API is organized into four main modules:

1. **Auth (`auth.py`)**
   - User authentication and management
   - Login, registration, profile management

2. **School Management (`school_management.py`)**
   - School creation and management
   - School requests
   - Classroom management
   - Role assignments
   - Access codes
   - Direct school joining

3. **Academic Management (`academic_management.py`)**
   - Subject management
   - Teacher/student subject assignments
   - Academic status endpoints

4. **Grades (`grades.py`)**
   - Assignment management
   - Grade management
   - Grade reporting and analytics

### Shared Utilities

Common functions used across multiple endpoints are stored in `utils.py`:
- Role checking and verification
- Access code generation
- Role assignment helpers

## API Route Structure

- `/` - Root endpoint
- `/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/auth/...` - Authentication endpoints
- `/study-area/...` - School management endpoints
  - `/study-area/login-school/select-principal` - Login as principal
  - `/study-area/login-school/select-teacher` - Login as teacher
  - `/study-area/schools/available` - Get available schools
- `/study-area/academic/...` - Academic management endpoints
- `/study-area/grades/...` - Grades and assignments endpoints

## Recent Changes

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Pydantic Warnings**: Updated all schema files to use `from_attributes = True` instead of deprecated `orm_mode = True`
2. **Schema Compatibility**: Fixed `JoinRequestResponse` schema to include all required fields
3. **Model Field References**: Fixed `school_address` references to use correct `address` field from School model
4. **Endpoint Updates**: 
   - Removed `/join-school/request-teacher` endpoint
   - Added `/login-school/select-teacher` endpoint for teacher login
   - Updated route prefixes to avoid conflicts between modules

### API Endpoint Organization:
- **School Management** (`/study-area/`): School operations, role management, direct joining
- **Academic Management** (`/study-area/academic/`): Subject management, assignments
- **Grades Management** (`/study-area/grades/`): Grade-specific operations and reporting
- **School Invitations** (`/study-area/`): New email-based invitation system

## New Email-Based Invitation System

### How It Works:
1. **Principals** can invite teachers/students by email using:
   - `/study-area/invitations/create` - Single invitation
   - `/study-area/invitations/bulk-create` - Multiple invitations
   - `/study-area/invitations/my-school` - View all invitations

2. **Teachers/Students** can join schools using:
   - `/study-area/join-school/teacher` - Join as teacher (requires invitation)
   - `/study-area/join-school/student` - Join as student (requires invitation)
   - `/study-area/invitations/check-eligibility/{school_id}` - Check available invitations

### Benefits:
- âœ… No more complex access codes to manage
- âœ… Direct email-based invitations
- âœ… Automatic role assignment
- âœ… Prevention of duplicate memberships
- âœ… Principal control over who can join their school

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Pydantic `orm_mode` Warning**: 
   - âœ… **Fixed**: All schema files updated to use `from_attributes = True`

2. **Schema Validation Errors**:
   - âœ… **Fixed**: Updated `JoinRequestResponse` schema to include all required fields
   - âœ… **Fixed**: Corrected endpoint responses to match schema definitions

3. **Model Attribute Errors**:
   - âœ… **Fixed**: Updated references from `school_address` to `address` in School model

4. **Endpoint Conflicts**:
   - âœ… **Fixed**: Separated route prefixes to avoid duplicate endpoints
   - âœ… **Fixed**: Removed `/join-school/request-teacher` and added `/login-school/select-teacher`

### Development Notes:
- All endpoint modules now import shared utilities from `utils.py`
- Database models are automatically created on startup
- Router loading is verified during startup with endpoint counts
- All schema `Config` classes now use `from_attributes = True` for Pydantic v2 compatibility

## Database Models

- `users_models.py` - User models
- `study_area_models.py` - Study area models (schools, classrooms, roles, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   or use the provided scripts:
   ```
   ./start.sh  # Linux/Mac
   start.bat   # Windows
   ```

## Database Migrations (Markâ€‘Done Updates)

To align the database with the markâ€‘done model changes (sessionless uploads, blocks/assignments, progress fields), run the direct migration script:

1) Ensure you have a valid Postgres connection string in `DATABASE_URL` (includes sslmode if required)

2) Run the migration

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
# From users_micro directory
$env:DATABASE_URL = "<your_postgres_connection_string>";
python .\migrate_mark_done_updates.py
```

Linux/Mac:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="<your_postgres_connection_string>"
python ./migrate_mark_done_updates.py
```

The script is idempotent; it safely adds/updates:
- as_ai_submissions: session_id nullable, block_id, assignment_id, ai_* text columns, CHECK on lesson_id or block_id
- as_study_sessions: lesson_id nullable, block_id, status, completion_percentage, marked_done_at
- as_student_progress: blocks_completed, total_blocks, average_score, total_study_time, sessions_count, started_at, last_activity, completed_at

Optional verification queries (Postgres):

```sql
-- Check nullability and defaults
SELECT column_name, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('as_ai_submissions','as_study_sessions','as_student_progress')
   AND column_name IN (
      'session_id','block_id','assignment_id','ai_corrections','ai_strengths','ai_improvements',
      'lesson_id','status','completion_percentage','marked_done_at',
      'blocks_completed','total_blocks','average_score','total_study_time','sessions_count','started_at','last_activity','completed_at'
   )
ORDER BY table_name, column_name;

-- Check the CHECK constraint exists and is validated
SELECT conname, convalidated
FROM pg_constraint c
JOIN pg_class t ON c.conrelid = t.oid
WHERE t.relname = 'as_ai_submissions'
   AND conname = 'ck_as_ai_submissions_lesson_or_block';
```
