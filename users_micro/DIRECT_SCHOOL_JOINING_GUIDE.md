# Direct School Joining System - Implementation Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This new system allows logged-in users to join schools as principals or teachers by:
1. **Selecting from available schools** (instead of needing access codes)
2. **Providing their email** (for verification)
3. **Getting automatic or admin-approved access**

## ðŸ†• New Endpoints

    "principal_name": "John Doe",
    "total_students": 150,
    "total_teachers": 12,
    "is_accepting_applications": true,

## ðŸŽ¯ User Workflows

```

## ðŸ”§ Validation Rules

### Teacher Join Request:
- âœ… User must be logged in
- âœ… Email must match user's registered email
- âœ… School must exist and have a principal
- âœ… User cannot already be a teacher at that school
- âœ… Auto-assigns teacher role if user doesn't have it

- âœ… Can only approve if school still has no principal
- âœ… Auto-assigns principal role when approved

## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Integration Examples

### React Component for School Selection
```jsx
const SchoolSelector = ({ onSchoolSelect, userEmail }) => {
  const [schools, setSchools] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchAvailableSchools();
  }, []);

  const fetchAvailableSchools = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/study-area/schools/available', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
      });
      const schoolsData = await response.json();
      setSchools(schoolsData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch schools:', error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  const handleJoinAsTeacher = async (schoolId) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/study-area/join-school/request-teacher', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          school_id: schoolId,
          email: userEmail
        })
      });
      
      const result = await response.json();
      if (response.ok) {
        alert(`Success: ${result.message}`);
        onSchoolSelect(result);
      } else {
        alert(`Error: ${result.detail}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      alert('Failed to join school');
    }
  };

  const handleRequestPrincipal = async (schoolId) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/study-area/join-school/request-principal', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          school_id: schoolId,
          email: userEmail
        })
      });
      
      const result = await response.json();
      if (response.ok) {
        alert(`Success: ${result.message}`);
        onSchoolSelect(result);
      } else {
        alert(`Error: ${result.detail}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      alert('Failed to request principal role');
    }
  };

  if (loading) return <div>Loading schools...</div>;

  return (
    <div className="school-selector">
      <h3>Available Schools</h3>
      {schools.map(school => (
        <div key={school.id} className="school-card">
          <h4>{school.name}</h4>
          <p>{school.address}</p>
          <p>Principal: {school.principal_name}</p>
          <p>Students: {school.total_students} | Teachers: {school.total_teachers}</p>
          
          <div className="actions">
            {school.principal_name !== "No Principal Assigned" ? (
              <button onClick={() => handleJoinAsTeacher(school.id)}>
                Join as Teacher
              </button>
            ) : (
              <button onClick={() => handleRequestPrincipal(school.id)}>
                Request to be Principal
              </button>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Admin Principal Approval Component
```jsx
const PrincipalApprovalPanel = () => {
  const [pendingRequests, setPendingRequests] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchPendingRequests();
  }, []);

  const fetchPendingRequests = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/study-area/school-requests/principal-pending', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${adminToken}` }
      });
      const requests = await response.json();
      setPendingRequests(requests);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch requests:', error);
    }
  };

  const approveRequest = async (requestId) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/study-area/school-requests/${requestId}/approve-principal`, {
        method: 'PUT',
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${adminToken}` }
      });
      
      if (response.ok) {
        alert('Principal request approved!');
        fetchPendingRequests(); // Refresh list
      }
    } catch (error) {
      alert('Failed to approve request');
    }
  };

  const rejectRequest = async (requestId) => {
    const reason = prompt('Enter rejection reason:');
    if (!reason) return;

    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/study-area/school-requests/${requestId}/reject-principal?rejection_reason=${encodeURIComponent(reason)}`, {
        method: 'PUT',
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${adminToken}` }
      });
      
      if (response.ok) {
        alert('Principal request rejected');
        fetchPendingRequests(); // Refresh list
      }
    } catch (error) {
      alert('Failed to reject request');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="principal-approval-panel">
      <h3>Pending Principal Requests</h3>
      {pendingRequests.map(request => (
        <div key={request.id} className="request-card">
          <h4>{request.user_name} ({request.user_email})</h4>
          <p>Wants to be principal of: {request.school_name}</p>
          <p>Requested: {new Date(request.request_date).toLocaleDateString()}</p>
          
          <div className="actions">
            <button onClick={() => approveRequest(request.id)} className="approve">
              Approve
            </button>
            <button onClick={() => rejectRequest(request.id)} className="reject">
              Reject
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## ðŸ“Š Database Changes

The system adds new fields to the `school_requests` table:
- `request_type`: "school_creation", "principal_join", "teacher_join"
- `target_school_id`: ID of existing school (for join requests)
- `created_date`: Timestamp of request creation

Run the migration script to update your database:
```bash
python migrate_direct_joining.py
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of This System

1. **User-Friendly**: No need to remember/share access codes
2. **Self-Service**: Users can browse and select schools themselves
3. **Flexible**: Supports both access codes and direct joining
4. **Secure**: Email verification ensures users can only join with their registered email
5. **Admin Control**: Principal assignments still require admin approval
6. **Automatic**: Teacher joining is instant if school has principal

This system provides a much more intuitive way for users to join schools while maintaining proper security and approval workflows!
