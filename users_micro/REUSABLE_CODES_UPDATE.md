# Access Code System - Reusable Codes Update

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### Removed One-Time Use Restriction
- **Before**: Access codes were deactivated after successful use
- **After**: Access codes remain active and can be used multiple times

### Updated Behavior
1. **Student joins school**: Code remains active for future use
2. **Teacher joins school**: Code remains active for future use
3. **Duplicate prevention**: System prevents joining same school twice with same role
4. **Manual control**: Principals can still manually deactivate/reactivate codes

## üîÑ Files Updated

### 1. `Endpoints/study_area.py`
- Removed `access_code.is_active = False` from both join endpoints
- Added comments indicating codes remain active
- Updated endpoint descriptions

### 2. `ACCESS_CODE_SYSTEM.md`
- Updated documentation to reflect reusable nature
- Changed "One-Time Use" to "Reusable Codes"
- Updated workflow descriptions
- Updated security considerations

### 3. `test_new_access_codes.py`
- Updated test descriptions
- Added handling for duplicate joining attempts

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety

### Duplicate Prevention
- Users cannot join the same school twice with the same role
- Database constraints prevent duplicate student/teacher records
- Error handling provides clear feedback

### Code Management
- Codes remain tied to specific emails
- Principals maintain full control over code lifecycle
- Manual deactivation/reactivation still available

## üìã Current Workflow

### For Principals:
1. Generate unique access code for specific email
2. Share code with student/teacher
3. Code can be used multiple times by the same person
4. Manually deactivate only if needed

### For Students/Teachers:
1. Receive permanent access code from principal
2. Use code to join school (matches their email)
3. Can attempt to use same code again (will get "already joined" message)
4. Code remains valid indefinitely

## ‚ú® Benefits of Reusable Codes

1. **Simplicity**: Students/teachers don't need new codes
2. **Reliability**: No need to request new codes after use
3. **Flexibility**: Same code works for re-registration scenarios
4. **User-Friendly**: Less friction in the joining process
5. **Administrative Ease**: Principals manage fewer code requests

## üîí Built-in Protections

- **Email Validation**: Code only works with matching email
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot join same school/role twice
- **Principal Control**: Only school principals can generate codes
- **Unique Constraints**: Database prevents duplicate memberships

The system now provides permanent, reusable access codes while maintaining security and preventing abuse!
