Create EXACTLY 5 unique multiple choice questions to help a student improve in their weak areas based on their assignment feedback.

Context:
- Subject: {request.subject}
- Student Level: {student_level}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Weakness Areas: {weakness_areas_text}
- Assignment Feedback: {request.feedback}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate EXACTLY 5 questions - no more, no less
2. Each question MUST be unique and different from others
3. Each question should target one of the weakness areas mentioned
4. Provide EXACTLY 4 multiple choice options (A, B, C, D) per question
5. Include clear explanations for the correct answers
6. Make questions educational and encouraging
7. Focus on concept understanding, not just memorization
8. Use the assignment feedback as context to understand what the student struggled with

Response Format - Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure:
[
  {{
    "question": "Question text here?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
