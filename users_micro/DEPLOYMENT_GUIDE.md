# BrainInk Backend - Deployment Guide

## Complete Implementation Summary

✅ **COMPLETED FEATURES:**

### 1. Enhanced Database Models
- **UserRole Enum**: normal_user, student, teacher, principal, admin
- **User Model**: Updated with role relationships and proper field names
- **School Request System**: Complete workflow for school creation requests
- **School Management**: Full school CRUD with principal ownership
- **Access Code System**: Unique codes for student/teacher school joining
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive school statistics for principals

### 2. Complete API Endpoints

#### School Request Workflow
- `POST /study-area/school-requests/create` - Principal creates school request
- `GET /study-area/school-requests/pending` - Admin views pending requests  
- `PUT /study-area/school-requests/{id}/review` - Admin approves/rejects requests

#### School Management
- `GET /study-area/schools/my-school` - Principal views their school with stats
- `GET /study-area/schools` - Admin views all schools

#### Access Code System
- `POST /study-area/access-codes/generate` - Principal generates access codes
- `GET /study-area/access-codes/my-school` - Principal views their codes
- `DELETE /study-area/access-codes/{id}` - Principal deactivates codes

#### School Joining
- `POST /study-area/join-school/student` - Students join with access code
- `POST /study-area/join-school/teacher` - Teachers join with access code

#### Role Management
- `POST /study-area/roles/assign` - Admin assigns roles to users
- `GET /study-area/roles/all` - Admin views all roles
- `GET /study-area/users/by-role/{role}` - Admin views users by role

#### Analytics
- `GET /study-area/analytics/school-overview` - Principal views detailed analytics

### 3. Security Features
- **Role-based Access Control**: All endpoints check user roles
- **Email Verification**: School joining requires email match
- **Access Code Validation**: Expiration dates and usage limits
- **School Ownership**: Principals can only manage their own schools

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize roles (run once after DB creation)
python initialize_roles.py
```

### 2. First Admin Setup
1. Register a user through your registration system
2. Manually assign admin role in database OR use the role assignment endpoint
3. Admin can then assign roles to other users

### 3. Complete Workflow Example

#### A. Admin Setup
1. Create admin user
2. Admin assigns principal role to users who want to create schools

#### B. School Creation
1. Principal creates school request: `POST /study-area/school-requests/create`
2. Admin reviews and approves: `PUT /study-area/school-requests/{id}/review`
3. School is automatically created upon approval

#### C. Access Code Generation
1. Principal generates codes: `POST /study-area/access-codes/generate`
2. Codes can have expiration dates and usage limits
3. Separate codes for students and teachers

#### D. User School Joining
1. Students/teachers use: `POST /study-area/join-school/student` or `/teacher`
2. System verifies:
   - User exists and email matches
   - School exists  
   - Access code is valid and not expired
   - User not already enrolled
3. User role is automatically updated
4. User profile (Student/Teacher) is created

#### E. School Management
1. Principal views analytics: `GET /study-area/analytics/school-overview`
2. Principal manages access codes and classrooms
3. Principal can view all school statistics

## Testing

Use the provided test script:
```bash
python test_study_area.py
```

Update the BASE_URL in the script to match your API server.

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **School Request & Approval System**
✅ **Role-Based Access Control**  
✅ **Unique Access Codes with Expiration**
✅ **Email Verification for School Joining**
✅ **Comprehensive School Analytics**
✅ **Principal School Management**
✅ **Admin User & Role Management**
✅ **Complete Error Handling**
✅ **Database Relationships & Constraints**

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- Email notifications for school request status
- Bulk operations for access codes
- Student performance tracking
- Attendance management
- Parent portal integration
- Advanced analytics and reporting

## Database Schema

The system creates these tables:
- `roles` - User roles
- `users` - Updated with role relationships
- `school_requests` - Principal school requests  
- `schools` - Approved schools
- `classrooms` - School classrooms
- `access_codes` - Joining codes
- `students` - Student profiles
- `teachers` - Teacher profiles

All relationships are properly configured with foreign keys and cascading deletes where appropriate.

## Security Notes

- All endpoints require authentication
- Role checks use utility functions for consistency  
- Access codes have built-in security (expiration, usage limits)
- Users can only join schools they have valid codes for
- Principals can only manage their own schools
- Admins have full system access

The backend is now fully functional and ready for production use!
