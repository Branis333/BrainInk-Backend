# BrainInk Backend - Complete API Overview

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Your BrainInk backend is a FastAPI-based school management system with three main modules:

1. **Authentication Module** (`auth.py`) - User registration, login, JWT tokens
2. **Study Area Module** (`study_area.py`) - Schools, users, subjects, roles management  
3. **Grades Module** (`grades.py`) - Assignments and grading system

## üìä Database Models

### Core Entities:
- **Users** - Basic user accounts (students, teachers, principals, admins)
- **Schools** - Educational institutions with principals
- **Roles** - User permissions (normal_user, student, teacher, principal, admin)
- **Access Codes** - Email-specific invitation codes for joining schools
- **Subjects** - Courses within schools
- **Assignments** - Tasks given by teachers
- **Grades** - Student performance on assignments

### Key Relationships:
- Schools have one Principal (User with principal role)
- Users can have multiple roles (many-to-many)
- Students/Teachers belong to Schools
- Subjects have multiple Teachers and Students
- Assignments belong to Subjects and have Grades

## üîê Authentication System

### Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`

### 1. User Registration
```http
POST /register
```
**Body:**
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com", 
  "fname": "John",
  "lname": "Doe",
  "password": "secure_password"
}
```
**Response:** User object with auto-assigned `normal_user` role

### 2. User Login
```http
POST /login
```
**Body:**
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "password": "secure_password"
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "jwt_token_here",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "user_info": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

### 3. Get Current User Info
```http
GET /users/me
```
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
**Response:** Current user details with roles

## üè´ Study Area Module 

### Base URL: `http://localhost:8000/study-area`

## School Management Workflow

### 1. Create School Request (Any User)
```http
POST /school-requests/create
```
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
**Body:**
```json
{
  "school_name": "Green Springs High School",
  "school_address": "123 Education St, City, State"
}
```
**Purpose:** Any authenticated user can request to become a principal

### 2. Review School Requests (Admins Only)
```http
GET /school-requests/pending
```
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>`
**Response:** List of pending school requests with principal info

```http
PUT /school-requests/{request_id}/review
```
**Body:**
```json
{
  "status": "approved",  // or "rejected"
  "admin_notes": "School approved - good application"
}
```
**Effect:** If approved, creates school and assigns principal role

### 3. Get My School (Principals)
```http
GET /schools/my-school
```
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <principal_token>`
**Response:** School details with statistics (student count, teacher count, etc.)

---

## Access Code System (Core Feature)

### 4. Generate Access Codes (Principals Only)
```http
POST /access-codes/generate
```
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <principal_token>`
**Body:**
```json
{
  "school_id": 1,
  "code_type": "student",  // or "teacher"
  "email": "student@example.com"
}
```
**How it Works:**
- Principal generates email-specific codes
- Code automatically assigns role (student/teacher) when used
- If user exists, role is assigned immediately
- Codes remain active for reuse

### 5. Join School as Student
```http
POST /join-school/student
```
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <student_token>`
**Body:**
```json
{
  "school_name": "Green Springs High School",
  "email": "student@example.com",
  "access_code": "ABCD1234"
}
```
**Validation:**
- Email must match current user's email
- Access code must be for students and assigned to that email
- Creates Student record in database

### 6. Join School as Teacher
```http
POST /join-school/teacher
```
**Same format as student, but creates Teacher record**

## üîÑ Frontend Integration Guidelines

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Registration/Login** ‚Üí Store JWT token
2. **Get User Status** ‚Üí Determine user's current state and available actions
3. **Route to appropriate dashboard** based on roles

### Role-Based UI:
```javascript
// Example role checking
const userRoles = userData.roles;

if (userRoles.includes('principal')) {
  // Show principal dashboard
  // - School management
  // - Access code generation
  // - Analytics
} else if (userRoles.includes('teacher')) {
  // Show teacher dashboard  
  // - My subjects
  // - Create assignments
  // - Grade students
} else if (userRoles.includes('student')) {
  // Show student dashboard
  // - My subjects
  // - View assignments
  // - Check grades
} else {
  // Show options to join school or request principal status
}
```

### Error Handling:
```javascript
// Common HTTP status codes:
// 200 - Success
// 400 - Bad Request (validation errors)
// 401 - Unauthorized (invalid/missing token)
// 403 - Forbidden (insufficient role permissions)
// 404 - Not Found
// 500 - Server Error
```

### Required Headers:
```javascript
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

### School Workflow for Frontend:
1. **New User:** Register ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Join school with access code OR request to create school
2. **Principal:** Create school ‚Üí Generate access codes ‚Üí Manage subjects ‚Üí Assign teachers
3. **Teacher:** Join school ‚Üí Get assigned to subjects ‚Üí Create assignments ‚Üí Grade students  
4. **Student:** Join school ‚Üí Get added to subjects ‚Üí View assignments ‚Üí Check grades

### Key Frontend Components Needed:
- **Login/Register forms**
- **Role-based dashboards**
- **Access code input form**
- **School request form**
- **Subject management interface**
- **Assignment creation/grading interface**
- **Grade viewing interface**

## üöÄ Quick Start for Frontend

1. **Server URL:** `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Swagger Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. **Health Check:** `GET /health`

## üîß Testing the API

Use the test files provided:
- `test_new_access_codes.py` - Test access code system
- `test_multiple_roles.py` - Test role assignments
- `test_study_area.py` - Test school and subject management

The backend is designed to handle the complete school management workflow from user registration to grade reporting. Each endpoint has proper validation, error handling, and role-based access control.
