- Content generation is cached to reduce API calls
- Error handling ensures graceful fallbacks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **GEMINI_API_KEY not set**: Add the environment variable
2. **API quota exceeded**: Check Google AI Studio usage limits
3. **Content too long**: Textbook content is automatically truncated
4. **Generation timeout**: Large courses may take 30-60 seconds

### Support:
